# passwords-galore

Welcome to passwords-galore! This project is intended to create a password with any conditions the user sees fit.
The user can choose to add upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters! 

The user is prompted with an initial question of how many characters they would like to include in their password (8-128 characters). Followed by questions pertaining to upper case, lower case, number, and special character inclusion.

If incorrect criteria or values are put in - the user is prompted to enter a correct value.
